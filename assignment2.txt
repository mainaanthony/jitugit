staging area-git add-changes are prepared for commit

Branching and the advantages
  allowed developers to create branches to work on new features or bugs
  they are isolated from the main codebase until they are merged back in
  git merge is used to combine the changes made on the different branches
  git checkout/ git switch: to change the branch for instance git checkout trial would take ys to the branch trial
  git branch trial: creates a new branch called trial
  git merge trial would merge the changes that were in trial to the main branch
